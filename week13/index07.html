           <p>My technology for this week was Sass, I thought converting all of my CSS to Sass and then back again would be easy but it sure wasn't. The variables were hard to understand in the beginning, but the hardest part was getting the compiler happy. I used koala compiler and it was pretty nice. My only complaint is it was a bit too picky, two spaces instead of a tab was an error. But it did spit out the correct code as you can see if you click the about link at the top. This was actually pretty fun and I will probably use this in the future in addition to CSS. Also, thanks for being such a great teacher bother Bradshaw. I really learned a lot in this class. </p>
